    - **[Email Service](https://github.com/AmanPr01/EmailService)**: Utilizes Apache Kafka for asynchronous email notifications, enhancing the reliability and scalability of communication features.
    - **[Payment Service](https://github.com/AmanPr01/PaymentService)**: Integrates Stripe for secure payment processing, facilitating transactions with industry-standard security and ease of use.
    - **[Service Discovery](https://github.com/AmanPr01/ServiceDiscovery)**: Central registry for service registration and discovery, enabling dynamic interaction between microservices.
  - **Key Technologies**: 
    - **Spring Boot**: For developing and deploying microservices.
    - **Spring JPA**: For managing database interactions and transactions.
    - **MySQL**: For data storage and retrieval.
    - **Apache Kafka**: For asynchronous messaging and handling email notifications.
    - **OAuth 2.0**: For secure user authentication.
    - **Stripe**: For handling payment transactions.
  - **Challenges and Solutions**: 
    - **Scalability**: Designed the architecture to handle high traffic by distributing services and using dynamic service discovery.
    - **Security**: Implemented OAuth 2.0 to secure user data and access.
    - **Reliability**: Utilized Apache Kafka for reliable email delivery and integrated robust error handling mechanisms.
  - **Outcome**: Achieved significant improvements in system scalability, reliability, and user security. The application effectively supports over 10,000 concurrent users and transactions.
